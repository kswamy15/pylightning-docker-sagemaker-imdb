### pylightning-docker-sagemaker-imdb
### Sample Project to show how to Train a Deep Learning BERT Model on IMDB data using SageMaker and Pytorch Lightning Framework.
#### A Docker file is built using the Pytorch GPU image and Pytorch Lightning framework is installed in the image.
#### The ECR image is then used in the Estimator function of a Sagemaker session.
#### This Pytorch Lightning Sagemaker code was built using this AWS example https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/advanced_functionality/scikit_bring_your_own/container
